**Last updated:** 24. January 2026

This Privacy Policy explains how Breader ("we", "our", or "the app") collects, uses, and protects your personal data in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

## 1. Data Controller

**Name:** Victor Movileanu <br>
**Email:** [hello@breader.app](mailto:hello@breader.app) <br>
**GitHub:** [github.com/ViggieM](https://github.com/ViggieM) <br>
**LinkedIn:** [linkedin.com/in/movileanuv](https://linkedin.com/in/movileanuv)

## 2. Overview of Data Processing

Breader is a Progressive Web App (PWA) for managing bookmarks and reading materials. The app prioritizes privacy and operates with an "offline-first" approach, storing most data locally on your device. We process personal data only as necessary to provide the service.

---

## 3. Data We Collect and Process

### 3.1 Local Storage (Your Device)

Breader stores data locally on your device using browser storage technologies:

#### IndexedDB (via Dexie)
- **Data stored:** Bookmarks, notes, reading status, tags, keywords, metadata
- **Purpose:** Core app functionality, offline access
- **Legal basis:** Strictly necessary for service functionality (GDPR Art. 6(1)(b))
- **Retention:** Until you clear browser storage or uninstall the app

#### LocalStorage
- **Data stored:** Theme preferences, UI settings, user preferences
- **Purpose:** Personalization, app settings
- **Legal basis:** Strictly necessary for service functionality (GDPR Art. 6(1)(b))
- **Retention:** Until you clear browser storage

#### Service Worker Cache
- **Data stored:** Cached HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images for offline functionality
- **Purpose:** Enable offline access, improve performance
- **Legal basis:** Strictly necessary for PWA functionality (GDPR Art. 6(1)(b))
- **Retention:** Automatically managed by browser cache policies

### 3.2 Metadata Extraction Service

When you save a bookmark, Breader automatically fetches metadata (title, description, keywords, favicon, etc.) from the URL using our self-hosted metadata extraction service.

- **Service:** [Metadata Extractor](https://github.com/ViggieM/metadata-extractor) (open source)
- **Data sent:** The bookmarked URL only
- **Data returned:** Title, description, keywords, favicon, author, dates
- **No data persistence:** The service is stateless — it doesn't store fetched content, extracted metadata, or user requests
- **Isolated processing:** Each page fetch creates an isolated browser context that is closed immediately after use
- **Security:** SSRF protection, rate limiting, content sanitization via DOMPurify
- **Legal basis:** Contract performance (GDPR Art. 6(1)(b))

#### Offline Content (Separate IndexedDB)
- **Data stored:** Extracted article text and HTML from bookmarked URLs
- **Purpose:** Enable offline reading of saved articles
- **How it works:** When you choose to save an article for offline reading, Breader fetches the webpage through our server (acting as a proxy to bypass CORS restrictions), extracts the readable content using Mozilla's Readability library, and stores the result in a separate local IndexedDB database on your device
- **What is NOT stored on our servers:** The extracted article content is returned to your browser and stored locally only. We do not retain, cache, or store any article content on our servers or any third-party servers. The server-side processing is transient and exists only for the duration of the request.
- **Legal basis:** Strictly necessary for offline reading functionality (GDPR Art. 6(1)(b))
- **Retention:** Until you delete the offline content or clear browser storage
- **Privacy note:** This content is intentionally NOT synchronized to the cloud (Dexie Cloud) to keep third-party article content local to your device and avoid any copyright or data storage concerns

**Important:** All local storage is essential for the app to function. No consent is required for strictly necessary storage technologies under GDPR.

### 3.3 Account Data (Supabase)

If you create an account for synchronization features:

- **Email address:** For authentication and account recovery
- **User ID:** Unique identifier for your account
- **Session tokens:** For secure authentication
- **Account timestamps:** Creation date, last login
- **Legal basis:** Contract performance (GDPR Art. 6(1)(b))
- **Data location:** [SPECIFY: e.g., EU region (eu-west-1), or leave blank for user to fill]
- **Retention:** Until account deletion

### 3.4 Synchronized Data (Dexie Cloud)

If you enable cloud synchronization:

- **Bookmarks and notes:** Synchronized across devices
- **User ID and access control metadata:** For data isolation and security
- **Sync timestamps:** Last synchronization times
- **Legal basis:** Contract performance (GDPR Art. 6(1)(b))
- **Data protection:** All data is encrypted in transit (HTTPS/TLS) and at rest
- **Privacy model:** Private by default - your data is isolated and not accessible to other users
- **Retention:** Until account deletion or manual data removal

**Dexie Cloud Privacy Features:**
- Data is private by default with fine-grained access control
- End-to-end encryption for sensitive data
- GDPR-compliant user deletion (erases all associated data)
- No data selling or sharing for marketing purposes

- **IP address:** For request routing and security
- **Browser type and version:** For compatibility
- **Access times:** For performance monitoring
- **Referring URLs:** For traffic analysis
- **Legal basis:** Legitimate interest (GDPR Art. 6(1)(f)) - security, performance optimization, and DDoS protection
- **Data location:** Cloudflare's global network with EU data centers
- **Retention:** Automatically deleted after [SPECIFY PERIOD, e.g., 30 days]

**Data Protection Measures:**
- Cloudflare acts as a data processor on our behalf

### 3.6 Analytics (PostHog)

Breader uses PostHog for privacy-focused analytics to understand how features are used and improve the app. We have configured PostHog with strong privacy protections:

**What we track:**
- Feature usage events only (e.g., "bookmark created", "search used")

**Data details:**
- **Legal basis:** Legitimate interest (GDPR Art. 6(1)(f)) — improving the app based on aggregate usage patterns
- **Data location:** EU (PostHog EU servers at eu.i.posthog.com)
- **Retention:** According to PostHog's data retention policies
- **Optional:** Analytics is completely disabled if the PostHog API key is not configured
